# Real-Time Network Traffic Classification with Learned Feature Imputation and SDN-Based Automated Response.

This repository contains the full implementation of our **real-time machine learningâ€“based intrusion detection and mitigation framework**.  
The system integrates **Zeek** for live flow monitoring, **feature approximation and neural network imputation** to complete the CICFlowMeter 77-feature schema, **TensorFlow Serving** for classification, and the **Ryu SDN controller** for real-time enforcement.  
A **Gradio-based dashboard** provides real-time monitoring of traffic classification outcomes.  

The work demonstrates how flow-based deep learning models, trained on CICIDS2017/2018, ToN-IoT, and application datasets, can be **deployed in a hybrid Windowsâ€“Ubuntu testbed** to classify network traffic and enforce security policies dynamically.
